* Calc in Racket

This is a simple tree-walking interpreter that can interpret files
written in Racket.

It uses the =parser-tools/{lex,lex-sre,yacc}= standard libraries for
lexing and parsing respectively. Great stuff.

Looking at =parse.rkt= should give a good indication of how to use the
language.

To run a file, run this from the command line:
#+begin_src shell
  $ racket main.rkt [file-to-interpret]
#+end_src

For example, the following:
#+begin_example
  a = 1;
  b = 1;
  limit = 150;

  while b < limit {
        println b;
        tmp = b;
        b = a + b;
        a = tmp;

        if b > limit {
             print "Reached end of iteration with b = ";
             println b;
        }
  }
#+end_example

yields:

#+begin_example
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
89
144
Reached end of iteration with b = 233
#+end_example
